# Book Review: The Powers of the Earth

Anarcho-capitalism, genetically enhanced intelligent DOGS who hate the government more than I do, a moon colony for expat billionaires (and anyone else who wants to live tax-free), AI, gun-toting CEOs who aren't afraid to blast government ships out of the, uh, space-sky, and the statist goons trying to shut them down.

Knowing that about the *[Powers of the Earth,](https://www.amazon.com/Powers-Earth-Aristillus-Book-ebook/dp/B005JPPMS6)* my only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner. It's that good. But when I bought the novel a year ago on Amazon, I had assumed it would be another poorly writtem, failed attempt to recreate what Ayn Rand did in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, which is to say, 
libertarianism dressed up in ragged shawl of a story. So I sat on the book for a while and it wasn't until I found some [negative reviews](http://morlockpublishing.com/travis-j-i-corcoran/) with calls for the author to be arrested (and 
a certain Cato Institute analyst raging that it wasn't actually libertarian)[^1] that I knew I just had to read it.

I wasn't disapointed. Whatever its flaws (and let he who could write better cast the first criticism!), *The Powers of the Earth*
is the first modern philosophical novel that I have read that does what *Atlas Shrugged* and *The Fountainhead* did so well: it manages to actually be an incredible story first and foremost. That it is explicitly anarcho-capitalist, and both unapologetically radical and
hilarious in its depiction of the ridiculousness of society and government in the not so distant future, had me feeling this book was written just for me.

It's a cliche, but I didn't want to put it down. Without giving away the plot at all, the heroes are heroic but believable, and the bad guys-of which there are many including slimy college journalists, politically-correct "woke" soldiers, self-serving polticians-are comically evil, incompetent, but not predictably so, and uncomfortabley apropos to our time. Every chapter had me hooked as I wanted to find out what happened to our moon colonists, and I rushed through the book and ordered the sequel immediately.
If you like science-fiction, especially of the fast-paced action variety, and freedom, you should read this.

As for the ideas in the book, if you're a thinking person, the author will make you think while still driving the plot forward. 

- How does a society without government manage property disputes? 
- How do private security contracts work?
-  What happens when people have different definitions of freedom? 
-  What does Earth look like in the future if the dominant ideas and spirit of our time continue unchallenged? 

Even as someone who had read almost all there is to read of anarcho-capitalist thought, I
found myself enjoying and engaging with it all.

If you're an unthinking person, or someone who hates freedom or individual success (often one in the same) well, the book will probably offend you. If you're woke, this book will outrage you,
though it may just change your mind about some things too. 

At least, I'd like to think it will change some minds, though it may be that this is a novel for what Albert Jay Knock calls "the remnant." If thats the case, thats more of an indictment of society than the book. As for me, I will
re-read it sometime and gift it often.

You can buy the book with my affiliate link [here](https://www.amazon.com/Powers-Earth-Aristillus-Book-ebook/dp/B005JPPMS6). I recommend the hardcover, which is very study.

[^1]: This is how you know its actually very libertarian. I'll read almost anything the Cato Institute tries to cancel.
